# LED Array Control with Arduino Uno

This project enables individual control of an array of 8 LEDs using an Arduino Uno. Each LED is connected to a separate digital pin on the Arduino, allowing for versatile light patterns and displays.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- Array of 8 LEDs
- Resistors (330 Ohm)
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Connections

1. Connect the common ground of the LED array to the GND pin of the Arduino Uno.
2. Connect the positive terminal of each LED to a separate digital pin (0-7) on the Arduino Uno.
3. Insert a 330 Ohm resistor in series with the positive terminal of each LED, connecting it to the digital pin.

## Result
The LED array project successfully demonstrates the individual control of 8 LEDs using an Arduino Uno. Each LED responds accurately to signals sent by the Arduino Uno, allowing for versatile lighting patterns and displays.
